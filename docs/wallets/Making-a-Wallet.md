# Making a DERO Wallet

The only official wallet for DERO is the CLI wallet. The GUI Wallet is planned for release by early Q3.


## CLI Wallet

 The CLI Wallet is written in Golang, and is in alpha but very stable and fast.

You can check out [this guide](Using-the-CLI-Wallet) for steps on using it.

## GUI Wallet

There is currently no GUI Wallet :( It is planned for release by early Q3.
