# Frequently Asked Questions



## Algorithm/ASIC Questions

#### Q: Why is DERO not ASIC resistant?

   A: There is an arms racing going on between PoW and mining hardware developers. As soon as a new PoW algorithm is released, the developers of mining hardware start to make FPGA prototypes which later turn into ASICs. The big threat hereby is hidden mining, that is someone is using FPGA/ASICs on a network where everyone else has only CPU/GPU available. DERO decided that the time of the developers is best spent developing new features for DERO and not engaging in this arms race. Thats why the PoW algorithm is still Cryptonote.

## Mining Questions

#### Q: How do I start mining DERO?

   A: You can check out [this guide](mining/Mining) for steps on getting started with mining DERO.

## Wallet/Daemon Related Questions

#### Q: When will the GUI and mobile wallets be ready?

   A: The GUI wallet is scheduled for early Q3 2018 so please be patient. The Android/IOS wallet development is also due to start soon.

There is no scheduled date or rough ETA at this time beyond what has been posted here.


#### Q: How do I restore my wallet from a seed or keys?

   A: You can check out [this guide](wallets/Using-the-CLI-Wallet#restoring-your-wallet).

#### Q: Why is my balance not what it should be?

  A: Type `balance` and press enter, and check if the balance is accurate.

If it still not, then type `11` and press enter to rescan the blockchain for any transactions.

#### Q: What do I do if I’m having synchronization issues?

   A: If you’re having synchronization issues, please restart your daemon/wallet.
     If the issue continues, please delete your `mainnet` folder and sync again.
     *Your daemon must be 100% synced before using your wallet.*

## Other Questions

#### Q: Why does Dero update so frequently?

   A: Our development team have many years experience in the field of cryptography and blockchain. They used this knowledge to build a new one-of-a-kind blockchain technology.

As such, they’re extremely familiar with every line of Dero’s code, algorithms, small details, and make meaningful contributions to the code on a very regular basis.


#### Q: Why are there changes to the roadmap or things that were talked about earlier?

   A: Our development team are heavily involved in research and development for the Dero Project. When they discover something does not meet the requirements of Dero, our team moves on to a better solution for the Dero Project.

If you have questions about why something has changed, you can inquire about it on our [Slack Channel](https://deroproject.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtMzAwMDc5MDY4NDUzLTAzOWNjYWZmNDgxZTk1YjNiNWFiYjg1OWNiMmQ2MmUxOWRmNjNjOWM3ODAzMzE3M2RhNzBhZjUyZGQxYjQxY2U) or [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GmDgjkD)

#### Q: When is Dero going to get on new exchanges?

   A: DERO is working diligently to get listed on high quality exchanges.

Simply stated, it is not exerting energy or resources to get listed on low quality or questionable exchanges. For more information, you can use the `\exchange` command in Slack or ask about it on there.

#### Q: Why don’t you just use *[insert idea]* from *[insert project]* to save time?

   A: Dero has it’s own unique development path and will do what is best for Dero as it is a one-of-a-kind blockchain technology that requires similar solutions.

Dero’s development team take the time to properly evaluate all options, they do not rush, nor will they.

#### Q: Where can I see the total circulating supply of Dero?

   A: You can check the [explorer](https://explorer.dero.io/) or use the `status` command in the daemon.

#### Q: Where can I see the up to date source code?

   A: Our developers make regular updates to the code on their end, however, it may take a little longer before you see it pushed to GitHub. Please keep an eye on our [GitHub](https://github.com/deroproject/derosuite) for updates.

#### Q: Is Dero going to change the transaction fees?

   A: Dero is going to work on changing the transaction fees now that we are on the new network.

#### Q: I have a question that isn’t listed here, where do I go?
