## Algorithm/ASIC Questions


#### Q: Is Dero switching to a new PoW algo and if so, which one? When?

   A: The Dero team has chosen to remain ASIC-friendly and use the cryptonight algo for now, to help ensure chain safety while they prepare for DERO-DAG. It will come out when the developers are confident we are ready to make the switch.
